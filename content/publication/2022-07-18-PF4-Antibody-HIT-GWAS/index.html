abstract: 'Heparin, a widely used anticoagulant, carries the risk of an antibody-mediated adverse drug reaction, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). A subset of heparin-treated patients produces detectable levels of antibodies against complexes of heparin bound to circulating platelet factor 4 (PF4). Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, we aimed to identify genetic variants associated with anti-PF4/heparin antibodies that account for the variable antibody response seen in HIT. We performed a GWAS on anti-PF4/heparin antibody levels determined via polyclonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Our discovery cohort (n = 4237) and replication cohort (n = 807) constituted patients with European ancestry and clinical suspicion of HIT, with cases confirmed via functional assay. Genome-wide significance was considered at α = 5 × 10−8. No variants were significantly associated with anti-PF4/heparin antibody levels in the discovery cohort at a genome-wide significant level. Secondary GWAS analyses included the identification of variants with suggestive associations in the discovery cohort (α = 1 × 10−4). The top variant in both cohorts was rs1555175145 (discovery β = −0.112 [0.018], P = 2.50 × 10−5; replication β = −0.104 [0.051], P = .041). In gene set enrichment analysis, 3 gene sets reached false discovery rate-adjusted significance (q < 0.05) in both discovery and replication cohorts: “Leukocyte Transendothelial Migration,” “Innate Immune Response,” and “Lyase Activity.” Our results indicate that genomic variation is not significantly associated with anti-PF4/heparin antibody levels. Given our power to identify variants with moderate frequencies and effect sizes, this evidence suggests genetic variation is not a primary driver of variable antibody response in heparin-treated patients with European ancestry.'
