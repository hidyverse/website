Check [my linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidiesteiner/) for updates on my career path. tldr; I accepted a position with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmacueticals and now work as a clinical trial statistician - aka all my career goals have come true. 

I am diving head first into expanding my clinical trials knowledge. I am applying my love of R programming, my graduate-level education of biostatistics, and my doctoral research skillset to clinical trial design, observation, and reporting.
